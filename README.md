## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

- Internet connection and browser
- A source code editor(preferably Visual Studio Code)
- Browser
- Install nodeJS along with NPM

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

-Local environment with `git clone https://github.com/ONJoseph/mathmagicians.git`

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Install

Install this project with:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Run `npm i` on the root of the project and you're good to go. All of the necessary packages will be installed for you!

### Usage

To run the project, execute the following command:

- Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/ONJoseph/mathmagicians.git`
- Change directory into the project folder: `cd mathmagicians`
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- A new browser will open automatically with application loaded

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment

You can deploy this project using:

- Run `npm run build` for Webpack to generate the dist files corresponding to your actual /src file
