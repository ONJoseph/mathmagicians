      Mathematics, the science of structure, order, and relation that has
      evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring, and describing
      the shapes of objects. It deals with logical reasoning and quantitative
      calculation, and its development has involved an increasing degree of
      idealization and abstraction of its subject matter. The study of
      mathematics as a &quot;demonstrative discipline&quot; began in the 6th
      century BC with the Pythagoreans, who coined the term
      &quot;mathematics&quot; from the ancient Greek μάθημα (mathema), meaning
      &quot;subject of instruction&quot;. Since the 17th century, mathematics
      has been an indispensable adjunct to the physical sciences and technology,
      and in more recent times it has assumed a similar role in the quantitative
      aspects of the life sciences.

      In many cultures—under the stimulus of the needs of practical pursuits,
      such as commerce and agriculture—mathematics has developed far beyond
      basic counting. This growth has been greatest in societies complex enough
      to sustain these activities and to provide leisure for contemplation and
      the opportunity to build on the achievements of earlier mathematicians. At
      the end of the 19th century the International Congress of Mathematicians
      was founded and continues to spearhead advances in the field.
